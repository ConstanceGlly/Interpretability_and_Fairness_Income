<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims at creating a relevant algorithm predicting the income threshold from the 1994 US census database whilst taking into account key interpretability and fairness stakes.   

Here are some of the main points we looked at from an interpretability and fairness point of view :
* race
* age
* gender

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

to use this model you need to set up a new environment with conda of venv 

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* conda 
  ```sh
  conda create --file environment.yml
  ```
* venv
  ```sh
  ### fill
  ```
Please make sure that you run this command once you are in the cloned or copied directory 

### Installation

_You will also need to install the requirements.txt package this should be done automatically once you have created the environment. however if it did need work you can still run _

* Clone the repo
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
